# z2q: zero to quake

An attempt at writing a game engine compatible with Quake 1 game data (PAK, WAD,
LMP, BSP, MDL, SPR, WAV, RC, DEM, etc) from scratch. It would be neat to have
Windows and MacOS support, a client/server split with both QW and NQ, software
rendering, and a variety of other features, but this is my first serious attempt
at anything like this and I donâ€™t have much experience programming, so this
might not even go anywhere.
